commonly used protocols in internet-based applications and services.

HTTP is the protocol used to transfer data between a client (such as a web browser) and a server (such as a website). When you visit a website, your web browser sends an HTTP request to the server, asking for the webpage or other resource you've requested. The server then sends an HTTP response back to the client, containing the requested data.

HTTPS is a more secure version of HTTP, which encrypts the data being transmitted between the client and server using SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security) encryption. This provides an additional layer of security, helping to protect sensitive information such as login credentials, payment information, and other personal data.

When you visit a website that uses HTTPS, your web browser will display a padlock icon in the address bar, indicating that the connection is secure. You may also see the letters "https" at the beginning of the website address, rather than "http".

Building Applications with TCP/IP
TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) is the underlying communication protocol used by most internet-based applications and services. It provides a reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data between applications running on different devices.

When building applications with TCP/IP, there are a few key concepts to understand:

Ports: Ports are used to identify the application or service running on a device. Each application or service is assigned a unique port number, allowing data to be sent to the correct destination.
Sockets: A socket is a combination of an IP address and a port number, representing a specific endpoint for communication. Sockets are used to establish connections between devices and transfer data between applications.
Connections: A connection is established between two sockets when two devices want to communicate with each other. During the connection establishment process, the devices negotiate various parameters such as the maximum segment size and window size, which determine how data will be transmitted over the connection.
Data transfer: Once a connection is established, data can be transferred between the applications running on each device. Data is typically transmitted in segments, with each segment containing a sequence number and other metadata to ensure reliable delivery.
When building applications with TCP/IP, you'll need to ensure that your application is designed to work with the appropriate ports, sockets, and connections. You'll also need to be familiar with the various protocols and standards that are commonly used with TCP/IP, such as HTTP, FTP (File Transfer Protocol), and SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol). Understanding these concepts and protocols is essential for building effective, scalable, and secure internet-based applications and services.ï¿¼Enter
